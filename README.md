# Web-based-room-booking
A sample project to enable teachers/event organisers to book rooms or halls online

This project was my first ever web based project and was made while I was learning HTML,CSS, JavaScript, Jquery, PHP so all the coding practices used are not exactly text book.

I m pretty sure in someplaces I used the downloaded Jquery files where as in others used the online one.

Any ideas for improvements are welcomed.

Stay tuned for more :D

Cheers
